===========
Cost Center
===========

This module allows the user to link every invoice line to a cost center
providing an extra dimension for the analysis.


Usage
=====

This module is relevant when you are creating sales invoices and using analytic accounting.

Start using cost centers by defining the cost centers. Be aware that Analytic Accounting
must be activated on the user for the following menu option.
Use the menu in the accounting module:

    **Configuration > Analytics accounting > Cost centers**

Once defined you can add a cost center to an invoice line. A default cost center for
the current invoice can be set in the other info tab.

This module adds the cost center concept to the reporting module.

    **Accounting > Invoice Analysis**

Here you can select or unselect the cost center within your analysis.
